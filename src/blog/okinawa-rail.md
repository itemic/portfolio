A reason why I wanted to get my website set up was so that I could have a place to document some of the signs I've encountered in my travels. I tried creating an Instagram account, but that didn't work as well for collections, and I stopped a few months after making it. There's still some work to be done for the layout of these posts, but it'll do for now.

This post will attempt to revive my "sign collection" — and we begin with some train station signage from Okinawa Prefecture.

The Naha Monorail only has one line and the entirety of Okinawa prefecture only has one rail-based public transport system. This made it challenging for me to get around, as buses weren't all that frequent either.

And that marks the end of the first post on my new website — in my opinion much more exciting than a "Hello, world!" or "Just setting up my blog". Here's hoping this design stays up long enough and I find myself adding more content (#contentcreator!).
